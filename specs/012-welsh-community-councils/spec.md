## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the UK Public Sector Organisation Aggregator, I need access to data about Welsh community councils, Scottish community councils, and Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Trusts so that I have a comprehensive view of these local public sector bodies alongside existing organisation data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the aggregator is run, **When** data collection completes, **Then** Welsh community councils from Wikipedia should be included in the output
2. **Given** the aggregator is run, **When** data collection completes, **Then** Scottish community councils from Wikipedia should be included in the output
3. **Given** the aggregator is run, **When** data collection completes, **Then** Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Trusts should be included in the output
4. **Given** multiple data sources are processed, **When** the aggregator completes, **Then** all three new organisation types should be properly classified and deduplicated

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Wikipedia page structure changes?
- How does system handle community councils with the same name in different regions?
- What happens if the NI Direct health trusts page is unavailable?
- How are dissolved or merged councils handled?
