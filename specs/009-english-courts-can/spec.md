**Feature Branch**: `009-english-courts-can`
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "english courts can be found at https://factprod.blob.core.windows.net/csv/courts-and-tribunals-data.csv\
ni courts can be found at https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/northern-ireland-courts-and-tribunals-service\
scottish courts at https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/courts-and-tribunals/courts-tribunals-and-office-locations/find-us/#/court-locator"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified three data sources for UK courts
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: System aggregator
   � Actions: Fetch, parse, aggregate court data
   � Data: English courts (CSV), NI courts (HTML), Scottish courts (web app)
   � Constraints: Three different formats, different jurisdictions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked data completeness questions
   � Marked validation requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Defined aggregation workflow
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Created testable requirements for each data source
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Court, Location, Contact, Services
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties about data formats"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a government data aggregator, I need to collect and standardize court and tribunal information from all UK jurisdictions (England & Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland) so that I can provide a complete view of UK judicial institutions as public sector organisations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the English courts CSV is available, **When** the system fetches the data, **Then** all courts and tribunals from England and Wales should be imported with their location and contact details
2. **Given** the NI courts webpage is accessible, **When** the system parses the page, **Then** all Northern Ireland courts should be extracted with their addresses and contact information
3. **Given** the Scottish courts locator is available, **When** the system accesses the data, **Then** all Scottish courts and tribunals should be retrieved with their locations
4. **Given** courts from all three sources are fetched, **When** the aggregation completes, **Then** the total count should represent all UK courts without duplicates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the CSV format changes structure?
- How does system handle when NI webpage is temporarily unavailable?
- What if Scottish courts locator requires JavaScript execution?
- How are courts that serve multiple jurisdictions deduplicated?
- What happens if a court appears in multiple sources with different details?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST fetch and parse English/Welsh courts data from the CSV file at https://factprod.blob.core.windows.net/csv/courts-and-tribunals-data.csv
- **FR-011**: System MUST extract court names, addresses, and types from the English courts CSV
- **FR-012**: System MUST parse Northern Ireland courts from https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/northern-ireland-courts-and-tribunals-service
- **FR-013**: System MUST retrieve Scottish courts data from https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/courts-and-tribunals/courts-tribunals-and-office-locations/find-us/#/court-locator
- **FR-014**: System MUST categorize courts by type (e.g., Crown Court, Magistrates' Court, County Court, Tribunal, Sheriff Court)
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve jurisdiction information (England & Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland)
- **FR-016**: System MUST capture location details including full address and postcode where available
- **FR-017**: System MUST extract all available courts data without requiring specific count validation
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle missing or incomplete data gracefully without failing the entire import
- **FR-019**: System MUST filter to include only open/active courts where status information is available
- **FR-020**: System MUST NOT attempt deduplication between sources (handled separately)
- **FR-021**: Contact information (phone, email, website) MUST be captured where available
- **FR-022**: System MUST extract data from API/network requests directly without using browser automation

### Key Entities
- **Court**: Represents a court or tribunal (name, type, jurisdiction, status)
- **Location**: Physical address of the court (address lines, town/city, postcode, region)
- **Contact**: Communication details (telephone, email, website, DX number if applicable)
- **Services**: Types of cases handled (criminal, civil, family, tribunals)
- **Jurisdiction**: Geographic or legal area served (local authority, region, national)

## Additional Context

### Data Source Details
1. **English Courts CSV**: Direct download, likely structured data with consistent format
2. **Northern Ireland Courts**: HTML webpage requiring parsing, may have less structured format
3. **Scottish Courts**: Interactive web application, may require special handling for data extraction

### Expected Data Volume
- England & Wales: All available courts and tribunals from CSV
- Northern Ireland: All courts listed on the webpage
- Scotland: All courts accessible via API/network requests
- Total expected: No specific validation threshold required

### Data Quality Considerations
- Different sources may have varying levels of detail
- Standardization will be required across jurisdictions
- Some courts may serve multiple purposes or jurisdictions
- Only open/active courts included where status is available
- Deduplication will be handled as a separate concern
- Data extraction via direct API calls, not browser automation
