# Implementation Plan: Northern Ireland Schools Data Integration

**Branch**: `008-ni-schools-you` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-ni-schools-you/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integration of Northern Ireland schools data from the NI Education Department into the UK Public Sector Organisation Aggregator. The system will fetch school data using a two-step process similar to the example script: first retrieving session tokens from the initial page, then making an authenticated export request to download all school data. Approximately 1122 open schools will be parsed, validated, and integrated into the existing aggregated dataset.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: axios (HTTP requests), cheerio (HTML parsing), xlsx (Excel parsing)
**Storage**: JSON files (existing pattern)
**Testing**: Jest with ts-jest
**Target Platform**: Node.js CLI application
**Project Type**: single - CLI aggregator tool
**Performance Goals**: Process ~1122 schools within 30 seconds
**Constraints**: Fail-fast on source unavailability, validate count ±10%
**Scale/Scope**: ~1122 Northern Ireland schools with full metadata

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (single CLI project with tests)
- Using framework directly? YES (axios, cheerio, xlsx directly)
- Single data model? YES (Organisation interface only)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (direct service implementation)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? YES (ni-schools-parser service)
- Libraries listed:
  - ni-schools-parser: Fetches and parses NI schools data
  - ni-schools-mapper: Maps raw data to Organisation format
- CLI per library: YES (via main CLI orchestrator)
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? YES

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual HTTP calls in integration tests)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? YES
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✓

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (CLI only)
- Error context sufficient? YES

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Uses existing project version
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (new feature)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project - CLI aggregator)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract tests for parser and mapper [P]
- Implementation of NISchoolsParser service
- Implementation of NISchoolsMapper service
- Integration into orchestrator
- End-to-end testing

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Parser → Mapper → Orchestrator integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md including:
1. Contract tests (2 tasks)
2. Parser implementation (3-4 tasks)
3. Mapper implementation (2-3 tasks)
4. Orchestrator integration (2 tasks)
5. Integration tests (2-3 tasks)
6. Documentation updates (1-2 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
