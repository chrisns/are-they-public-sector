# Feature Specification: Northern Ireland Schools Data Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-ni-schools-you`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "NI schools, you can see how to get a list of schools by reading the a list @nischools/run_minimal.sh use that purely as a example how, do not call it from the code but recreate what its doing in our app so that we get northern ireland schools in to the code base"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extract: Northern Ireland schools data integration requirement
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: NI schools, data export, integration into aggregator
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Data format for export
   � Update frequency requirements
   � School information scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Define workflow for fetching and processing NI schools data
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Focus on data retrieval and integration
6. Identify Key Entities (schools data structure)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Ensure all requirements are clear
   � Remove any implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the UK Public Sector Organisation Aggregator, I want Northern Ireland schools data to be included in the aggregated dataset so that I have a complete view of all UK public sector educational institutions, including those in Northern Ireland.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the aggregator is run, **When** Northern Ireland schools data source is processed, **Then** all active NI schools should be included in the output with correct organisation details
2. **Given** a Northern Ireland school exists in the source system, **When** the data is fetched and processed, **Then** the school should appear in the aggregated output with name, location, and type information
3. **Given** the Northern Ireland schools data source is temporarily unavailable, **When** the aggregator attempts to fetch data, **Then** the system should fail fast with a clear error message
4. **Given** the Northern Ireland schools data format has changed, **When** the parser attempts to process the data, **Then** the system should detect the format change and fail with an appropriate error

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the NI schools data source is unavailable?
  � System should fail fast with clear error messaging
- How does system handle duplicate schools that might appear in multiple sources?
  � Deduplication process should identify and merge duplicate entries
- What happens if school data is incomplete (missing required fields)?
  � Parser should validate required fields and reject incomplete records
- How does system handle different school types (primary, secondary, special)?
  � All school types should be captured with appropriate categorization

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve a complete list of Northern Ireland schools from the official government source
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse school information including name, type, and location details
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that all required school fields are present before processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate Northern Ireland schools data into the existing aggregated dataset
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle all types of Northern Ireland schools (primary, post-primary, special, nursery)
- **FR-006**: System MUST fail fast if the data source is unavailable or returns an error
- **FR-007**: System MUST fail fast if the data format has changed from the expected structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST deduplicate Northern Ireland schools against existing school records from other sources
- **FR-009**: System MUST export Northern Ireland schools in the standard Organisation format used by the aggregator
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate the total count of schools retrieved is approximately 1122 (±10% tolerance for changes)
- **FR-011**: System MUST filter to include only open schools in the output, excluding closed or proposed schools
- **FR-012**: System MUST capture all available school information from the source including management type, address, and any other metadata provided

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Northern Ireland School**: Represents an educational institution in Northern Ireland with attributes including school name, type (primary/post-primary/special/nursery), location, management type, and operational status
- **School Type**: Classification of the educational level and specialization of the school
- **School Status**: Operational state of the school (active, closed, proposed)
- **Management Type**: Administrative classification of the school (controlled, voluntary, integrated, etc.)
