# Feature Specification: NHS Trusts and Local Authorities Data Integration

**Feature Branch**: `004-you-can-pull`  
**Created**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "you can pull a list of nhs trusts from https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-provider-directory/ and local authorities from https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/links?view=la"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Extract: NHS Trusts source URL, Local Authorities source URL
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: NHS Trusts, Local Authorities, data sources, aggregation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Define fetching and parsing workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Check for completeness and clarity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the UK Public Sector Organisation Aggregator, I want to include NHS Trusts and Local Authorities in the aggregated dataset, so that I have a comprehensive view of all UK public sector organisations including healthcare providers and local government bodies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the aggregator is running, **When** it fetches data from configured sources, **Then** it includes NHS Trusts from the NHS Provider Directory
2. **Given** the aggregator is running, **When** it fetches data from configured sources, **Then** it includes Local Authorities from the DEFRA UK-AIR links page
3. **Given** NHS Trusts and Local Authorities are fetched, **When** the aggregator processes the data, **Then** they are included in the unified JSON output with consistent structure
4. **Given** duplicate organisations exist across sources, **When** deduplication runs, **Then** NHS Trusts and Local Authorities are properly deduplicated with existing data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the NHS Provider Directory format changes? System should fail with clear error (runs nightly, breaking changes will be detected)
- How does system handle if Local Authorities page structure changes? System should fail with clear error (runs nightly, breaking changes will be detected)
- What happens if either source is temporarily unavailable? System should fail completely (no partial data)
- How are NHS Foundation Trusts vs NHS Trusts differentiated? Foundation Trusts have "Foundation" in their name

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch NHS Trusts data from the NHS Provider Directory publication
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch Local Authorities data from the DEFRA UK-AIR links page
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse NHS Trust names and identifiers from the source data
- **FR-004**: System MUST parse Local Authority names and identifiers from the source data
- **FR-005**: System MUST map NHS Trusts to the unified organisation schema with appropriate type designation
- **FR-006**: System MUST map Local Authorities to the unified organisation schema with appropriate type designation
- **FR-007**: System MUST deduplicate NHS Trusts and Local Authorities against existing organisations in the dataset
- **FR-008**: System MUST include total counts for NHS Trusts and Local Authorities in the aggregation summary
- **FR-009**: System MUST parse NHS Provider Directory HTML page listing trusts alphabetically
- **FR-010**: System MUST parse Local Authorities HTML page with unordered list structure organized by alphabetical sections
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate NHS Trust records (best effort - extract available name and type information)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate Local Authority records (best effort - extract available name and URL information)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **NHS Trust**: Healthcare provider organisation in the NHS, with name, code, type (Trust/Foundation Trust), and potentially region/area
- **Local Authority**: Local government organisation, with name, code, type (County/District/Unitary/Metropolitan), and geographic area
- **Organisation**: Unified entity that both NHS Trusts and Local Authorities map to, containing standardised fields for cross-source compatibility
