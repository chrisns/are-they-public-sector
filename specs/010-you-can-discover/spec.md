# Feature Specification: Groundwork Trusts and NHS Charities Data Integration

**Feature Branch**: `010-you-can-discover`
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "you can discover groundwork trusts from https://www.groundwork.org.uk/find-groundwork-near-me/ you can discover the NHS charities from https://nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/about-us/nhs-charities-across-the-uk/ you'll note there is a url like https://api.storepoint.co/v1/163c6c5d80adb7/locations?rq you should discover this url from the page, but in that json payload you'll find a list of the NHS Charities in England and Wales"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identify two data sources: Groundwork Trusts and NHS Charities
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: System (data aggregator)
   � Actions: Discover/scrape data from websites, parse API responses
   � Data: Groundwork Trusts locations, NHS Charities locations
   � Constraints: Must extract API URL from HTML page for NHS Charities
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Data format for Groundwork Trusts webpage needs investigation
   � Specific fields to extract from each source
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Define data extraction workflows for both sources
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each source needs separate extraction logic
   � API discovery requirement for NHS Charities
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Groundwork Trust organisation
   � NHS Charity organisation
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Mark technical details to be moved to implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data aggregator system, I need to collect information about Groundwork Trusts and NHS Charities from their respective websites so that these organisations can be included in the UK public sector organisation dataset.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Groundwork Trusts website is accessible, **When** the system fetches data from the "find groundwork near me" page, **Then** all active Groundwork Trust locations should be extracted with their names and locations
2. **Given** the NHS Charities Together website is accessible, **When** the system discovers the API endpoint from the webpage, **Then** it should successfully fetch the JSON data containing NHS Charities in England and Wales
3. **Given** both data sources have been fetched, **When** the data is processed, **Then** both Groundwork Trusts and NHS Charities should be added to the aggregated dataset with appropriate classification

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Groundwork Trusts website structure changes? System should fail after retry attempts
- How does system handle if the NHS Charities API URL cannot be discovered from the page? System should fail after retry attempts
- What happens if either website is temporarily unavailable? System should retry and then fail if still unavailable

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch Groundwork Trusts data from https://www.groundwork.org.uk/find-groundwork-near-me/
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract organisation names and locations for all Groundwork Trusts listed
- **FR-003**: System MUST discover the API endpoint URL from the NHS Charities Together webpage at https://nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/about-us/nhs-charities-across-the-uk/
- **FR-004**: System MUST fetch JSON data from the discovered NHS Charities API endpoint
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract NHS Charities data specifically for England and Wales from the API response
- **FR-006**: System MUST classify Groundwork Trusts as Central Government bodies (per ONS classification)
- **FR-007**: System MUST classify NHS Charities as Central Government bodies (per ONS classification)
- **FR-008**: System MUST include whatever fields are available from the sources (name, address, website, contact details, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle missing or incomplete data gracefully (minimum viable data is organisation name)
- **FR-010**: No deduplication required between sources

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Groundwork Trust**: Represents a Groundwork Trust organisation with location, name, and classification as Central Government body (S.1311) sponsored by Department for Communities and Local Government
- **NHS Charity**: Represents an NHS Charity organisation in England or Wales with location, name, and classification as Central Government body (S.1311) sponsored by Department of Health
- **Organisation Location**: Geographic information including whatever is available (address, coordinates, region, postcode)
