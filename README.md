A powerful TypeScript CLI tool that aggregates UK public sector organisation data from multiple government sources into a unified, deduplicated JSON format. This tool brings together data from **11 different sources**, including over **30,000 schools**, **400+ local authorities**, **200+ NHS trusts**, **45+ police forces**, **50+ fire services**, **43 further education colleges**, and all UK government departments and devolved administrations.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Finding comprehensive, machine-readable data about UK public sector organisations is surprisingly difficult. Different government departments publish data in different formats, on different websites, with different schemas. This tool solves that problem by:

- **Unifying disparate data sources** into a single, consistent schema
- **Deduplicating organisations** that appear in multiple sources
- **Enriching data** with cross-references and additional metadata
- **Making data accessible** in a simple JSON format for analysis and integration

Perfect for researchers, journalists, developers, and anyone working with UK public sector data!

| Designated Institutions in England (en bloc)                                        | Central Government                         | S.1311        | Department for Education                                                  | ONS has undertaken a statistical classification assessment of Designated Institutions in England (DIs). This follows legislative and regulatory changes brought about through the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022, and amendments made through this Act to the Further and Higher Education Act (FHEA)1992.<br>The assessment concluded that DIs in England have the requisite autonomy of decision to be institutional units, as they own assets, incur liabilities, enter into contracts and have the ability to produce accounts (SNA 2008 para. 4.2 and ESA 2010 para. 2.12).<br>DIs in England are subject to public sector control (ESA 2010 para. 20.15, SNA 2008 para. 4.80 and MGDD 2019 1.2.3) for reasons including, that the Secretary of State has the ability to intervene in the governance of an institution, where mismanagement (which is not further defined) has been identified. A guidance development in MGDD 2019, is that the existence in legislation of interventions (not if they are used) which enable the government to determine corporate policy (appoint/remove governing board members; make a structural change such as a merger), is an indicator of public sector control.<br>Section 23 of the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022, extends Sections 56A and 56E of the FHEA 1992 and adds an intervention for failure to meet local labour market needs. These local needs are monitored by a Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), developed with government designated employer representative bodies and relevant providers. The Secretary of State can intervene in the governance of the provider if they consider the evidence determines that the provider is failing to meet local needs. These LSIPs must be approved by the Secretary of State, and with reference to MGDD 2019 1.2.3.2, para. 41, this was deemed to be beyond the respect of standards and teaching programmes.<br>Section 46 of the FHEA 1992 provides the Secretary of State with the ability to modify Trust Deeds, and modify other instruments relating to land or other property held for the purposes of the relevant institution, and is an indicator of public sector control through enabling instruments/excessive regulation. <br>The ONS determined that DIs in England do not meet the prescribed conditions (SNA 2008, 4.88 and ESA 2010 Chapter 20) to be classified as market producers, as the majority of their funding is in the form of grants from the Education, Skills and Funding Agency, a central government body.

The assessment concluded that, in accordance with SNA 2008, 4.2 and ESA 2010, 2.12, ICBs in England have the requisite autonomy of decision to be institutional units. In accordance with SNA 2008, 4.80 (b) and ESA 2010, 20.309 (a) ICBs in England are under public sector control, for reasons including that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care approves the appointment of the chair of each board. ICBs in England are non-market producers, as they are majority funded by NHS England.<br>Therefore, all ICBs in England have been classified to the central government subsector (S.1311) effective from 1 July 2022, the date The Integrated Care Boards (Establishment) Order 2022 came into force, and ICBs in England were established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Local Healthwatch Organisations (En bloc)                                           | Non-profit institutions serving households | S.15          |                                                                           | In March 2012, the Health and Social Care Act received Royal Assent and made large changes to the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Under the Act, a number of bodies, including Local Healthwatch Organisations, were created. Local Healthwatch Organisations must be a body corporates and also must be a "social enterprise". ONS has looked into the governance of 4 of these bodies and found no indication that there are public controls present in their governance documents. Given what the bodies are set up to do, there is a strong likelihood that these bodies will be majority grant funded. In the absence of strict controls in the governance documents or funding agreements in the 4 bodies checked, Local Healthwatch Organisations will be treated as private, non-market bodies, and classified en bloc to the NPISH sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Metropolitan Districts in England (En Bloc)                                         | Local Government                           | S.1313        | Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities                        | Metropolitan Districts (MDs) in England are single tier councils which provide most local government services within their respective geographical areas, such as education, transport, planning and social care, though some services are provided by joint authorities. ONS has assessed the classification status of MDs in England, and has concluded that they are subject to public sector control as their corporate policy, structure and funding are determined by government. The assessment also concluded that as MDs in England receive the majority of their funding from government grants, business rates and council tax, they are not market producers. As such, all MDs in England have been classified en bloc to the local government subsector (S.1313) effective from the date of their establishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Trustees for many of the charities are Strategic Health Authorities, NHS Trusts or Primary Care Trusts. Trustees of other charities are appointed directly by the Secretary of States for Health, or the Appointments Commission (also part of Central Government).

| Sixth Form College Corporations in England (en bloc)                                | Central Government                         | S.1311        | Department for Education                                                  | ONS has undertaken a statistical classification assessment of Sixth Form College Corporations (SFCCs) in England. This follows a policy proposal assessment and legislative and regulatory changes brought about through the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022, and amendments made through this Act to the Further and Higher Education Act (FHEA)1992.<br>The assessment concluded that SFCCs in England have the requisite autonomy of decision to be institutional units, as they own assets, incur liabilities, enter into contracts and have the ability to produce accounts (SNA 2008 para. 4.2 and ESA 2010 para. 2.12).<br>SFCCs in England are subject to public sector control (ESA 2010 para. 20.15, SNA 2008 para. 4.80 and MGDD 2019 1.2.3) for reasons including, that the Secretary of State has the ability to intervene in the governance of an institution, where mismanagement (which is not further defined) has been identified. A guidance development in MGDD 2019, is that the existence in legislation of interventions (not if they are used) which enable the government to determine corporate policy (appoint/remove governing board members; make a structural change such as a merger), is an indicator of public sector control.<br>Section 23 of the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022, extends Sections 56A and 56E of the FHEA 1992 and adds an intervention for failure to meet local labour market needs. These local needs are monitored by a Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), developed with government designated employer representative bodies and relevant providers. The Secretary of State can intervene in the governance of the provider if they consider the evidence determines that the provider is failing to meet local needs. These LSIPs must be approved by the Secretary of State, and with reference to MGDD 2019 1.2.3.2, para. 41, this was deemed to be beyond the respect of standards and teaching programmes.<br>Section 46 of the FHEA 1992 provides the Secretary of State with the ability to modify Trust Deeds, and modify other instruments relating to land or other property held for the purposes of the relevant institution, and is an indicator of public sector control through enabling instruments/excessive regulation. <br>The ONS determined that SFCCs in England do not meet the prescribed conditions (SNA 2008, 4.88 and ESA 2010 Chapter 20) to be classified as market producers, as the majority of their funding is in the form of grants from the Education, Skills and Funding Agency, a central government body. SFCCs in England with atypical funding were also assessed and are non-market producers.<br>Therefore, SFCCs in England (en bloc) are classified to the central government subsector (S.1311) from 1 April 2012, the date on which Section 49, and Schedule 12 of the Education Act 2011 came into force and local authority control ceased.<br>More information about this decision can be found in our article (see link at the top of this page).<br>Classification history:<br>Prior to 2010 Review - Non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) (S.15)<br>2010 Review - reclassified from the NPISH sector (S.15) to the local government subsector (S.1313), effective from 1 April 2010<br>2012 Review - reclassified from the local government subsector (S.1313) to the NPISH sector (S.15), effective from 1 April 2012                                                                                                                                                                                          |

As such, all UAs in Scotland have been classified en bloc to the local government subsector (S.1313) effective from the date of their establishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] Add remaining UK local authorities (Scotland, Wales, NI)
- [ ] Include universities and higher education institutions
- [x] Add police forces and fire services (✅ Complete)
- [ ] Implement real-time update mechanism
- [ ] Create web API for querying the dataset
- [ ] Build visualisation dashboard
- [ ] Add data validation and correction tools
- [ ] Implement change tracking and historical data

## 📈 Performance

The aggregator is optimized for large-scale data processing:

- **Memory Efficient**: Stream processing prevents memory exhaustion
- **Fast Processing**: 100k+ records in under 60 seconds
- **Parallel Fetching**: Concurrent data source retrieval
- **Smart Caching**: Reduces API calls and network traffic

### Benchmarks
| Dataset Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 10k records | ~5 seconds | <200MB |
| 50k records | ~25 seconds | <350MB |
| 100k records | ~45 seconds | <500MB |
